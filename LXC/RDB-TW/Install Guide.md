Known Errors:

# [red] Bot doesn't have any owner set!
a) pass --team-members-are-owners when launching Red - in this case Red will treat all members of the bot application's team as owners
b) set owner manually with redbot --edit <instance_name>
c) pass owner ID(s) when launching Red with --owner (and --co-owner if you need more than one) flag

Red BOT
 â€” Today at 12:37 PM
1. Take note of the installed cogs and cog repositories with [p]cogs, then [p]load downloader, then [p]repo list.
2. Stop the bot, ideally with [p]shutdown.
3. Run redbot-setup backup <instancename> in your venv.
4. Copy the backup file to the new machine/location.
5. Extract the file to a location of your choice (remember the full path and make sure that the user you are going to install/run Red under can access this path).
6. Install Red as normal on the new machine/location.
7. Run redbot-setup to create a new instance, except use the path you remembered above as your data path.
8. Start your new instance.
9. Re-add the Repos using the same names as before.
10. Do [p]cog update
11. Re-add any cogs that were not re-installed (you may have to uninstall them first as Downloader may think they are still installed)
Note: The config (data) from cogs has been saved, but not the code itself.
